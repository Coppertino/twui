// during a dragging session. It does nothing if out of the application.
// It is initially assigned the source of the dragging operation, but
// can be re-assigned for internal-use context passing.
@property (nonatomic, strong) id sessionContext;

// During the conclusion of an accepted drag, if this property is set to
// YES, the drag session will animate each dragging image to their
// TUIDraggingFormationNone locations. Otherwise, the drag images are
// removed without any animation. This property is inspected between
// prepareForDragOperation: and performDragOperation:. You should
// enumerate through the dragging items during performDragOperation:
// to set the itemâ€™s draggingFrame to the correct destinations.
// This property is of no use to a dragging source.
@property (nonatomic, assign) BOOL animatesToDestination;

// Controls whether the dragging image animates back to its starting
// point on a cancelled or failed drag. -draggingSession:endedAtPoint:operation:
// is a good time to change this value depending on the result of the
// drag operation. The default value is YES.

// During draggingEntered: or draggingUpdated:, you are responsible for
// returning the drag operation. In some cases, you may accept some,

// application may only accept image files.) If you only accept some
// of the items, set this property to the number of items accepted so
// the drag manager can update the drag count badge. When
// updateDraggingItemsForDrag: is called, you should set the image of
// non-valid dragging items to nil. If none of the drag items are valid
// then you should not updateItems:, simply return NSDragOperationNone
// from your implementation of draggingEntered: and, or draggingUpdated:
// and do not modify any drag item properties.
// This property is of no use to a dragging source.

// Returns the dragging operation mask of the dragging source. The dragging
// operation mask, which is declared by the dragging source through the
// TUIDraggingSource draggingSession:sourceOperationMaskForDraggingContext:
// method. If the source does not permit any dragging operations, this method
// should return NSDragOperationNone.
@property (nonatomic, assign, readonly) NSDragOperation draggingOperation;

// Enumerate through each dragging item. Any changes made to the properties
// of the draggingItem are reflected in the drag when the destination is
// not overriding them. Classes in the provided array must implement the
// NSPasteboardReading protocol. Cocoa classes that implement this protocol
// include NSImage, NSString, NSURL, NSColor, NSAttributedString, and
// NSPasteboardItem. For every item on the pasteboard, each class in the
// provided array will be queried for the types it can read using
// -readableTypesForPasteboard:. An instance will be created of the first
// class found in the provided array whose readable types match a conforming
// type contained in that pasteboard item. If an instance is created from
// the pasteboard item data, it is placed into an TUIDraggingItem along with
// the dragging properties of that item such as the drag image. The
// TUIDraggingItem is then passed as a parameter to the provided block.
// Additional search options, such as restricting the search to file URLs
// with particular content types, can be specified with the search options.
// Note: all coordinate properties in the TUIDraggingItem are in the coordinate
// system of view. If view is nil, the screen coordinate space is used.
